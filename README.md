# GroovyWithMongoDB
In this miniproject, I developed a rapid prototype that processes Twitter data, storing it in a MongoDB instance on the Cloud. The application will then obtain some business intelligence from the data extracted using MongDB API from Groovy.

Description:
 1. Creating MongoDB instance in the cloud and setting up the connection
 2. Loading json data as documents into MongoDB using JsonSlurper.
 2. Filter the json data by given categories using Groovy and find the respective proportion of tweets.
 3. Infer Intelligence Part using MongoDB query and Groovy script:
     --> Finding top 5 liked tweets
     --> Finding top 5 retweeted tweets
     --> Finding top 5 users with more followers.
  
 Knowledge Gained:
  1. Learnt a new scritping knowledge Groovy and understood the purpose of gradle
  2. Application of MongoDB and NoSQL technologies
  3. Querying process of MongoDB APIs.
  4. Deeply explored NoSQL datastores and its applications in various ways.
  5. Investigation and understanding of Twitter Database Architecure at the core.
